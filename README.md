# Car-Rental-System
We are a team of 3 university students working on a Car Rental System (CRS for short).
Short Description: The Car Rental System (CRS) is designed to help car rental companies in 
transferring services online to public, which enables the car rental company in 
keeping records regularly about the processes. It's aim is to make renting cars easier, faster and saving time as well as 
cost, while increasing the ease of availability for car rental services to the public.
